----Step 1: Adding MD5 checksum column in source table.
alter table `change-data-capture-317101.CDC_Dataset.CDC_Source` add column md5checksum bytes;

----Step 2 : Updating the value for MD5checksum column.
update `change-data-capture-317101.CDC_Dataset.CDC_Source` set 
md5checksum= md5(concat(cast(employee as string), name, cast(department as string), dept_name,state,model,category,cast(year as string)))
where 1=1;

----Step 3: Historical load.
-------------------- First time Historical Load ---------------------------------
create or replace table `change-data-capture-317101.CDC_Dataset.CDC_Final`
as 
select * ,concat(employee,'|',Department,'|',model) as Business_Key,
'Y' as current_record ,---> It will mark N if any updates.
'N' as is_deleted, -----> It will mark to Y if the record is deleted.
current_timestamp as effective_dt, -----> It will show us the created date as the current timestamp.
cast (null as timestamp) as enddate, -----> It will update to the current timestamp if there is an update for the previous record.
current_timestamp as last_updated_dt ----> It will update if there is any update or delete happens for a particular record.
from `change-data-capture-317101.CDC_Dataset.CDC_Source`;

----Before proceeding to step 4 we have to do step 1 & step 2 for the new source file.

----Step 4: Incremental Load.

call `change-data-capture-317101.CDC_Dataset.sp_cdc`();
